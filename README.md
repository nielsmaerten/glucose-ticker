## FAQ

### Windows says this app is unsafe?

TLDR: **Relax; it's fine!** 

Windows shows this warning because the app is not [digitally signed](https://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft+authenticode).

Digitial signatures are expensive, and since this is a hobby-project I didn't want to pay for one.

### My icon isn't updating?

Try the following:

* Make sure you started the app using the shortcut in your Start Menu, or on your Desktop
  * If you create your own shortcut, point it to the .bat file. Shortcuts pointing to the .exe won't work.
* Open the app and minimize it again
* Make sure the app is **not pinned** to the taskbar
